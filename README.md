# StockPricePredictor
Predicting Stocks Price on the basis of stock prices of last 60 days.

My model depends only on the closing prices of last 60 days. The model doesnot take the recent news into consideration, so there might be difference in the predicted price and actual price of the market.

Achieved R2 Score of 0.956 in the model.
